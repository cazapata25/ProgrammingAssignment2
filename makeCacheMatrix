## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix ##above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the ##cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = numeric()) {
        m <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                m <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setsolve <- function(solve) m <<- solve
        getsolve <- function() m
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setsolve = setsolve ,
             getsolve  = getsolve )
}
